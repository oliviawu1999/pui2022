Part c: Description
Description: In 300 words (only!) describe your website. Include the following:
i. What is the purpose of your website?
ii. What information do you convey with your website?
iii. How is it interesting and engaging?
iv. Who is the target audience?

In this project, I aim to create an interactive portfolio for myself for the purpose of presenting to potential employers. I plan to make my design interactive and engaging using animations such as scroll effects and hoving effects. My design will be accessible to display responsively to different screen dimensions, meaning that the website will adjust text size and images according to screen dimensions. 

On the home screen, I plan to use animation to convey my interests in solving design challenges with data. This means perhaps the text “data driven solutions'' will be moving and responsive to hovering. Moreover, scrolling on this page will enable transition to the all works page.


Part d: Using your website

Part e: External libraries
I used Bootstrap library because I want to make my website responsive to different devices to allow audience from different devices to have similar experience on my portfolio website. I implemented all the pages using bootstrap container and grid system. I made my website responsive by applying for example col-lg-6 and col-md-12 to the columns. Bootstrap library also allows me to create a carousel to display multiple images of the project in one space.

Part f: Iteration from HW7
In previous iteration, there is not much interactive about my website. This time, I decided to make the website more engaging and memorable with a few different interactive elements. These include the typewriter animation, hover effects, and carousels in my project pages.

Part g:
The major challenges I experienced was implementing the typewriter animation and hover effect animation. I had to search online for resources to teach myself how to make it work using javascript to show each letter one by one.
